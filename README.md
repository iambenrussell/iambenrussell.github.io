# Ben Russell's Portfolio

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

My name is Ben. I'm a DFW-area UX designer with additional experience in web development, project management, and QA. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a master's degree in Economics and Data Analytics, I spent three years as a product manager at a local tech startup. In this role, I had a number of responsibilities, including web design and development. My goal for 2021 is to continue building these skills while also working on some great products.

Feel free to take a look at my projects here or at iambenrussell.com. You can also reach out at brrussell93@gmail.com if you'd like to talk.
