					</div>
					<p>I'm a technical writer, UX designer, copywriter, and editor. Iâ€™m an empathetic communicator with a strong attention to detail. I recently spent three years as the product manager at a DFW tech startup called EPFirms, which included project management, design, writing, testing, and software development. I'm currently seeking opportunities that would benefit from my diverse skill set. To learn about my experience and projects, keep reading!</p>

							<h2 class="major">Technical Writing</h2>
							<p>
								As a technical writer, my number one goal is to avoid assumptions. Whether it involves the audience, the product, or internal stakeholders, a little communication can go a long way. Thatâ€™s why I ask questions early and often. Furthermore, I place high value on writing clarity, and my breadth of experience in the design and software space makes me uniquely suited toward a variety of audiences.

							<h2 class="major">UX Design</h2>
							<p>As a UX designer, my mission is to make software that is simple, useful, equitable, and fun. My strength lies in the ability to fully internalize a clientâ€™s needs and synthesize them in novel ways to solve multiple user problems. I pride myself on a deep toolkit of design patterns, as these are the language of digital interfaces.
							<br><br>
							<em>Primary experience: User interviews, personas, user journey maps, usability studies, UX writing, design software (Figma, Adobe XD, Invision, Photoshop)

						<div class="content">
							<h2 class="major">Copywriting and Editing</h2>
							<p>As a copywriter and editor, my greatest skill is my attention to detail. Iâ€™ve developed this trait throughout a variety of experiences, including software testing, quality assurance, and teaching (not to mention copywriting and editing). I also pride myself on literary tone. Whether writing or editing, I have the ability to match whatever tone is most appropriate.

								<h3 class="major">Work Instructions: Figma Button</h3>
								<p>Buttons are a key part of digital interfaces, and Figma makes it easy to create reusable button components. In these instructions, I walk a new user of Figma through the process of creating their own button component.</p>

In it, the artist is pictured from the shoulders-up, looking slightly to the left with a stoic gaze, while wearing a brown coat.

								<h3 class="major">Case Study: Audio Tours</h3>
								<p>Galleries are a valuable source of knowledge and entertainment, but some design oversights restrict their potential. I applied UX research and design methods to improve accessibility and the overall experience.</p>
