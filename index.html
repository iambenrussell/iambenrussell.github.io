					</div>
					<p>I spent three years as the product manager at a DFW tech startup called EPFirms. During my time there, I fell in love with design. As a UX designer, my job is to make software simple, useful, equitable, and fun. I'm currently seeking new opportunities. Below, I'll walk you through the basic steps for software development that have worked for me in the past.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Step 1: Decide on a Solution</h2>
							<p>
								Before settling on a solution, it‚Äôs crucial to fully understand the problem. As a product manager, I did this by getting as close to the users as possible. This meant observing their processes, conducting open-ended interviews, and synthesizing my findings. This helped my team to stay focused on the user's pain points and make sure they felt heard.

							<h2 class="major">Step 2: Design and Build the Solution</h2>
							<p>It can be difficult to turn a great idea into a real product without losing something in translation. In the past, I have worked to accurately assess the goals of various stakeholders, translate them into simple design patterns, visualize these patterns with wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes, and work side-by-side with engineering as they were developed. This ensured that everyone stayed on the same page.

						<div class="content">
							<h2 class="major">Step 3: Iterate on the Solution</h2>
							<p>Once a product is developed, the next step is to make sure it effectively solves the user‚Äôs problems. One of the most common ways to do this is with a usability study, where users are tasked with utilizing the product to reach a number of objectives. In previous roles, I collected information about our users‚Äô remaining pain points, without explaining how the product was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to work. This process revealed where we needed more refinement.

							<em>Primary skills: Post launch research, usability studies, surveys, UX writing (patch notes and blogs)</em></p>
