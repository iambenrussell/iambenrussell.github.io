# Ben Russell's Portfolio

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

My name is Ben. I'm a DFW-area UX designer with additional experience in product management and QA. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a master's degree in Economics and Data Analytics, I spent three years as a product manager at a local tech startup. In 2021, I pivoted toward UX and haven't looked back!

Feel free to take a look at my projects here or at https://iambenrussell.github.io. You can also reach out at brrussell93@gmail.com if you'd like to talk.

Thank you!
